# Bank-Loan-Report
Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard

This project is a complete Bank Loan Analysis System built using MS SQL Server for data processing and Power BI for interactive visualization.
The purpose of this project is to analyze loan applications, track funded vs received amounts, measure loan performance, and identify patterns in good vs bad loans.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The dataset contains loan application records with details such as:
Loan Amount,
Amount Received,
Interest Rate,
Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),
Loan Status,
Loan Purpose,
State & Home Ownership,
Employee Length, etc.


Using SQL, various KPIs and aggregated metrics were generated. These insights were then visualized in Power BI across three report pages:

Page	Description

**Summary :** Displays top-level KPIs, Good vs Bad loan distribution, and loan status overview.

 **Overview :** Shows monthly trends, term-based split, employee length impact, ownership & purpose-based loan performance.
 
 **Details :** Contains a detailed tabular loan-level view for deep analysis.
